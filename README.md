## Introduction
![](assets/fig1.png)
We introduce cost aggregation to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which jointly aggregates both image and text modalities within the matching cost.

For further details and visualization results, please check out our [paper](#) and our [project page](https://ku-cvlab.github.io/CAT-Seg/).

## Installation
Please follow [installation](INSTALL.md). 

## Data Preparation
Please follow [dataset preperation](datasets/README.md).

## Training
We provide shell scripts for training and evaluation. ```run.py``` trains the model in default configuration and evaluates the model after training. 

To train or evaluate the model in different environments, modify the given shell script and config files accordingly.

### Training script
```bash
# For ViT-B variant
sh run.sh configs/vitb_r101_384.yaml output/
# For ViT-L variant
sh run.sh configs/vitl_swinb_384.yaml output/
# For ViT-H variant
sh run.sh configs/vitl_swinb_384.yaml output/ MODEL.SEM_SEG_HEAD.CLIP_PRETRAINED "ViT-H" MODEL.SEM_SEG_HEAD.TEXT_GUIDANCE_DIM 1024
# For ViT-G variant
sh run.sh configs/vitl_swinb_384.yaml output/ MODEL.SEM_SEG_HEAD.CLIP_PRETRAINED "ViT-G" MODEL.SEM_SEG_HEAD.TEXT_GUIDANCE_DIM 1280
```

## Evaluation
```eval.sh``` automatically evaluates the model following our evaluation protocol, with weights in the output directory if not specified.
To individually run the model in different datasets, please refer to the commands in ```eval.sh```.

### Evaluation script
```bash
sh eval.sh configs/vitl_swinb_384.yaml output/ MODEL.WEIGHTS path/to/weights.pth
```
